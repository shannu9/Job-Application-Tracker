# 💼 AI-Powered Job Application Tracker

This project is a fully automated, AI-powered job application tracker that connects directly to Gmail, classifies job-related emails using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo, and updates a Google Sheet with real-time statuses such as “Applied”, “Interview Scheduled”, “Offer”, and “Rejected”. It supports multiple Gmail accounts, uses timestamp-based incremental scanning, and runs 24/7 on cloud platforms like Railway. The system also visualizes status counts in a dynamic dashboard tab and maintains historical integrity by matching applications and updating statuses with high accuracy.
